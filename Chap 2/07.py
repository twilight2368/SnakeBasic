######### INTRO TO DICTIONARIES #########

#dictionary stores key-value pairs
#The equiv of an associative array/hash table
emails = {
    "Caleb":"caleb@email.com", 
    "Gal":"g@example.com" 
}

print(emails)
#in this case, the key is the name, email is the value. 
#Data type doesn't matter at all for the value.
#Key must be a hashable --> What does this mean?
#Classes have a function __hash__ invoked when used as the key
print(hash("hello")) 

#I'm not sure of exact internals on how the hash is used, but imagine it like so:
#You have an area of memory with 8 spots, and you need to store the value at some spot...
print(hash("hello") % 8) 

#Almost always immutable type (should be, anyway)
#a tuple will work, list will not. a number will work

#Why use a hashtable? Extremely fast to add or look up data
#O(1) --> constant time. More elements does not mean slower unlike a sort or something
#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table
#Hashtables often used for memoization

#Next up we gonna talk about retrieving data from a dictionary


######### RETRIEVE DATA FROM DICTIONARY ##########


print(list(emails))
print(sorted(emails))
#print(emails[0]) # NOPE!
print(emails["Caleb"])

#Since data is not nicely sequenced
#we may want to check before we try grabbing stuff

if("Caleb" in emails):
    print("Emailing", emails["Caleb"])

#This may seem bad because we first check to see if its in
#Then we do another line to get the value
#but this is different than a list where we iterate to find the element
#The key is goes through hash to calculate index. Either there or not
#This is O(1)

#You may still not like the casing and in that situation there is a method

print(emails.get("Ryan")) #Returns none if not found
print(emails.get("Ryan", "Not found")) #optional return arg if not found


######### ADD DATA TO DICTIONARY #########


#How to add data (3 ways here):
#indexing
emails["josh"] = "josh@j.com"
print(emails)

#update function
emails.update( {"josh": "evennewer@email.com"})
print(emails)

#Weird variation
emails.update(josh = "new@email.com")
print(emails)

#Key must be hashable
# emails[5] = "test"
# emails[(1, 2)] = "yep"
#emails[[5, 3]] = "nope" #list is not hashable (mainly cuz mutable)


######### LOOPING THROUGH KEYS #########


#dictionary is an iterable (implements __iter__)

emails = {
    "Caleb":"caleb@email.com", 
    "Gal":"g@example.com",
    "Ted": "talk@gmail.com"
}

#k is a variable but k by convention for key
for k in emails:
    print(k)

#You can use the key to get the element 
#Not ideal.
#One reason being the key has to be hashed to get the value associated with it.
#(but will show better way in next section)
for k in emails:
    print("index", k, "is", emails[k])


######### LOOPING THROUGH KEY-VALUE PAIRS #########


#In the prev section we used the index with [].
#Although it works, you can do this:

for k, elem in emails.items():
    print(k, elem)

#Each iteration k will be the key and elem will be the item found at this key.

#As an example of what a hashtable can be used for, you can keep track of occurances:

conjunctions = {"but": 0, "or": 0, "so": 0, "and": 0, "yet": 0, "for": 0, "nor": 0} #fanboys

completely_original_poem = """I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me
I still feel your touch in my dreams
Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why
Without you it's hard to survive
'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling
And every time we kiss I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast, I want this to last
Need you by my side"""

words = completely_original_poem.split()

for word in words:
    if str.lower(word) in conjunctions:
        conjunctions[str.lower(word)] += 1

print(conjunctions)

#This could easily be wrapped in a function to take a msg and words to look for, returning a dict
#concept can be used to analyze documents to quantify how vulgar they are, search for phrases, etc
#dictionaries can be used to keep track of values that are hard to calculate (memoization)


######### SETS EXPLAINED #########


#Sets are similar to dictionaries in that the data is hashed and it is unordered.
#Sets are similar to lists in that they just contain the data and not a key-value pair
#Sets are different than lists in that you cannot have duplicates

stuff = {"sword", "rubber duck", "sice a pizza"}
print("sword" in stuff)
print(stuff)
stuff.add("sword")
print(stuff)
#Notice only one occurance of sword even though already added

#How is a set different than a dictionary?
#For a set, each element is only one piece of data
#for a dictionary, it is a key-value pair. 

#Behind the scenes, they both use hashing. The hashing is used to determine where to store the data.
#For dictionaries, the KEY is hashed
#for sets, we do not have a key, so the data itself is hashed.
#This means we cannot store something in sets that is not hashable.

#stuff.add(["trying to add a list"])

#It's important to understand the purpose of a set...
#Easily check if element in set
#such as to easily check to see if something has been tagged
#To do various set operations (coming soon)

#An example would be to see if a word is ever used in a phrase. Not counted (that wold be a dictionary)

conjunctions = {"but", "or", "so", "and", "yet", "for", "nor"} #fanboys
seen = set() #THERE'S NOT AN EMPTY SET LITERAL!! #learn something new every day
completely_original_poem = """I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me
I still feel your touch in my dreams
Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why
Without you it's hard to survive
'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling

######### REMOVE DUPLICATES FROM LIST / CREATE SET FROM LIST ##########

#You can remove duplicate elements from a list by converting it to a set and back. 

colors = ["red", "red", "green", "green", "blue", "blue", "blue"]

print(id(colors), colors)

colors[:] = list(set(colors))

print(id(colors), colors)


#Earlier on in our life I showed some code to count each type of element in a list. 

colors = ["red", "red", "green", "green", "blue", "blue", "blue"]

counts = [[colors.count(item), item] for item in set(colors)]

print(counts)

#This works because is iterates through the set {"red", "green", "blue"} counting each in colors


######### UNION AND INTERSECTION #########

my_fav = {"red", "green", "black", "blue", "purple"}
her_fav= {"blue", "orange", "purple", "green"}

#union
all_favs = my_fav | her_fav
print(all_favs) #no repetition
#You may see + to combine lists, in which there are repeats.
#But we are not working with lists...so i'll try to focus here.

#intersection (elements shared between both)
wedding_colors = my_fav & her_fav
print(wedding_colors)
#this is like the inside section of a venn diagram

#There are also method versions:
all_favs = my_fav.union(her_fav)
print(all_favs)

wedding_colors = my_fav.intersection(her_fav)
print(wedding_colors)


######### DIFFERENCE AND SYMMETRIC DIFFERENCE ######### 


my_fav = {"red", "green", "black", "blue", "purple"}
her_fav= {"blue", "orange", "purple", "green"}

#Difference
only_my_colors = my_fav - her_fav
print(only_my_colors) #elements in left getting rid of all in right. 
#Could go other way too:
only_her_colors = her_fav - my_fav
print(only_her_colors)

#symmetric difference is like if you took colors only I liked union with colors only she liked and put em together:

symmetric = my_fav ^ her_fav
print(symmetric)

#This is like:
symmetric = only_my_colors | only_her_colors
print(symmetric)

#like union and intersection, there are method versions that return. --> .difference and .symmetric_difference
